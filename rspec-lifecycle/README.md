# RSpec Lifecycle

This code was given by James Gifford at Upstart Engineering on 4/6/2020 as an
overview of the RSpec Lifecycle.

## How to run

1. First, install all the gems with:

```
bundle install
```

2. To run the tests and explore, use this command:

```
bundle exec rspec rspec_lifecycle_spec.rb -f d

```

You'll get output that looks like this:

```
âžœ  rspec-lifecycle git:(master) bundle exec rspec rspec_lifecycle_spec.rb -f d
